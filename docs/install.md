# Installing Hive

## Prerequisites

* [kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize#kustomize)
* [oc](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/oc/latest/)
* [go (version 1.12)](https://github.com/golang/go)
* [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)

## Deployment Options

Hive contains an operator which is responsible for handling deployment logic for the rest of the components.

### Deploy Hive Operator Using Latest Master Images

To deploy the operator from a git checkout:

  `$ make deploy`

By default the operator will use the latest images published by CI from the master branch.

You should now see hive-operator, hive-controllers, and hiveadmission pods running in the hive namespace.

### Deploy Hive Operator Using Custom Images

 1. Build and publish a custom Hive image from your current working dir: `$ IMG=quay.io/dgoodwin/hive:latest make buildah-push`
 2. Deploy with your custom image: `$ DEPLOY_IMAGE=quay.io/dgoodwin/hive:latest make deploy`

### Deploy Hive via OLM

We do not currently publish an official OLM operator package, but you can run or work off the test script below to generate a ClusterServiceVersion, OLM bundle+package, registry image, catalog source, and subscription.

`$ REGISTRY_IMG="quay.io/dgoodwin/hive-registry" DEPLOY_IMG="quay.io/dgoodwin/hive:latest" hack/olm-registry-deploy.sh`

#### Verify that Hive is running
Run: `$ oc get pods -n hive`

Sample output:

```bash
$ oc get pods -n hive
NAME                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hive-controllers-777bcb5b4d-nqw7w   1/1       Running   0          38m
hive-operator-57dc6446df-4wqnd      1/1       Running   0          38m
hiveadmission-5dfff7f575-4kcc4      1/1       Running   0          38m
hiveadmission-5dfff7f575-cqxgg      1/1       Running   0          38m
```

### Next Step

Provision a OpenShift cluster using Hive.
For details refer [using Hive](./using-hive.md) documentation.

### Deploy on Minishift

The Hive controller and the operator can run on top of the OpenShift(version 3.11) provided by [Minishift](https://github.com/minishift/minishift).

Steps:


* Enable the admission webhook validation plugin (for hiveadmission to work) and start minishift:
```bash
minishift addons enable admissions-webhook
minishift start
```

* Login to the cluster as admin

```bash
oc login -u system:admin
```

* Give cluster-admin role to `admin` and `developer` user

```bash
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin developer
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin admin
```

* Follow steps in [Deployment Options](#deployment-options)
